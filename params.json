{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"SudokuSolver is a Sudoku puzzle solver written in Java. Simply generate an input text file with the Sudoku puzzles to be solved, then run Solution.java to get the answers. \r\n\r\nThe first line of the input file should be the number of 3x3 Sudoku puzzles to be solved. Every subsequent line should have one row of the Sudoku puzzle with all numbers written together, without any spaces. Zeroes replace blank squares. The rows must be in the order they appear in the Sudoku puzzle, from top to bottom, with the first row of the next puzzle directly below the last row of the previous puzzle. There are no empty lines between any rows. \r\n\r\nSudokuSolver will then generate an output text file with the solution. As in the input file, the solved puzzle will be written with each row on a separate line, in the order the rows appear, with the first line of the next puzzle directly below the last line of the previous puzzle. If the puzzle is solvable, every zero in the original puzzle will be replaced with the correct number to solve the puzzle. \r\n\r\nSudokuSolver was created for the HackerRank University Hacker Olympics held at Columbia University in 2012.\r\n\r\n[back](http://shruti108.github.com)","name":"SudokuSolver","google":"","tagline":""}
